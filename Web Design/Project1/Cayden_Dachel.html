    <p>Menomonies Mayor, Randy Knaack, is excited about the Amazon Distribution center. He states that they will offer tons of jobs for people in the area, roughly 28 jobs inside the facility, and 50 drivers. He also stated that the whole Western Wisconsin should recieve products quicker. They hope to open the facility by the end of 2026, as of right now they do not have the size or cost of the building. </p>
    
    <p>During this time of expansion Amazaon is expected to add over 200 delievery stations, and create over 100,00 new jobs ranging from full time to part-time members. North Industrial Park was developed in Menomonie in 2007 and houses multiple different industrial businesses, they still currently have 230 acres available for other businesses.</p>

    <p><blockquote>"This has been in the works for several months; they bought the land outright," Knaack told the Leader-Tellegram on Tuesday. "I think it's a good thing for Menomonie."</blockquote></p>
